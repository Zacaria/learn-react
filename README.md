## Prequisites

## Purpose

> [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is javascript **library** for building User Interfaces
>
> -- Facebook

Since JQuery, web development has faced a lot of changes.

In 2010 Angular was released by Google.
It introduced a new way of dealing with front-end development, organizing complex User Interfaces through MVC / MVVM **architectures** using two-way data-binding.
And still today Angular 1.x is still one of the biggest front-end **framework**.

In 2013 React was released, mainly maintained by Facebook, Instagram and community.
As a library, React only handles the **view layer**. Focusing on **performance** and **scaling**, it features a virtual DOM and one-way data flow.
In order to make it more complete, facebook proposed to use it with [Flux](https://code-cartoons.com/a-cartoon-guide-to-flux-6157355ab207#.zayn2ojof) architecture.

In 2014, Google announced Angular2. The major changes it brings, would make the current version **incompatible** with Angular2.

This announce really shook the community. Developers began to seek for other solution. The **timing** was perfect for React to be the alternative.

This repo aims to help introducing React for developers.
