# Ideas

If you want to try React but have no idea of what to do. Here are some ideas to get you started.

- Begin with a dead simple counter
- Have multiple counters and give them title
- Replace counter by alarms
- Replace alarms by notes (like evernote)
- Add markdown support
- Add tags to posts
- Show a list of posts and filter them by name, tag, date

Something else :
- Create a tile map
- Implement tic tac toe
- Keep track of scores
